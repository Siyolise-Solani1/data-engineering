# data-engineering
This is a mini project to build a real-world DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT, E-Commerce Order Monitoring Pipeline using just Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow. I simulate order data, load it into Snowflake, transform it with dbt, and orchestrate everything using Airflow — complete with SLA alerting for delayed orders.
